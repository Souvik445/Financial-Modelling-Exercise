# FinancialModellingExercise
This is a financial model created to show widget sales over 5 seasonal sales models. 

Problem statement:

Build a spreadsheet which calculates the revenue generated from the sale of widgets, and the profit achieved from them after costs of sales. The inputs should be numbers of units sold, prices, and a cost per unit. The spreadsheet should run for two years on a monthly basis. Volumes will be based on an annual sales profile and there should be a growth factor from one year to the next. There should be 5 sales profiles (of your choice) which can be selected and switched between via a dropdown selection. Be as elaborate and imaginative as you want on presentation. Keep formulae consistent and clean, with no hard-coded numbers included. Inputs should be clearly separated from outputs.
